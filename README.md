# bioe21-final-project

This final project was created by Josue Carvente, Sammie Bulaon, and Ulices Ramierez-Vargas.

The User Manual contains how-to guides for executing each of our member's code in a user-friendly manner.

For our 6-star project, we have decided to work on the following:
* Josue Carvente: Collatz Conjecture (2-star)
* Sammie Bulaon: Online White Board (3-star)
* Ulices Ramierez: Prime Factorization (1-star)

Feel free to follow along and have fun executing our programs!
